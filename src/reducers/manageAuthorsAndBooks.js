// For learning purposes, our two reducers are in the same file,
// but it is common to separate each reducer into its own file.
// You could then either import each reducer into a new file,
// something like reducers/rootReducer.js,
//  where combineReducer is called. Or, alternatively,
//  you could include combineReducer in your src/index.js file.
